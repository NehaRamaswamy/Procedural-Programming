# Python Programs and Patterns

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python programs and Jupyter notebooks designed for beginners to learn and practice fundamental programming concepts. It focuses on control flow structures (like loops and conditionals), numerical patterns, asterisk-based geometric patterns, and classic algorithmic problems. The content is organized into folders for easy navigation and includes both basic exercises and more advanced variations.

Whether you're a student, self-learner, or educator, these notebooks provide hands-on examples to build skills in loops, conditionals, and problem-solving. All code is written in Python and can be run in Jupyter environments.

## Branches:
- **Main Branch**: Focuses on control flow and program examples.
- **Second Branch** (e.g., `dev` or similar): Includes expanded pattern sections and hollow variations.
- Switch branches with `git checkout <branch-name>` to explore differences.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into key sections: control flow basics, number patterns, asterisk and hollow patterns, and miscellaneous programs. Below is an overview of the contents.

### Control Flow Structures

This section covers essential looping and conditional constructs with practical examples.

- **For Loops** (`For_loop` folder):
  - `For_cdt.ipynb`: Demonstrates for loops with conditional statements.
  - `for_range.ipynb`: Explores the `range()` function in for loops.
  - `Nested.ipynb`: Examples of nested for loops for multi-level iterations.

- **While Loops** (`While_loop` folder):
  - `while_basic.ipynb`: Basic while loop implementations for repeated execution based on conditions.

- **If Statements** (`If_statement` folder):
  - Notebooks explaining conditional execution with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

### Number Patterns

A dedicated series of notebooks for generating numerical patterns using loops. These are excellent for practicing nested loops and arithmetic operations. Patterns range from simple sequences to complex designs.

- `Patterns_1.ipynb` to `Patterns_20.ipynb`: Progressive exercises creating various numerical structures, such as triangles, pyramids, and symmetric patterns.

### Asterisk and Hollow Patterns

These folders focus on printing geometric shapes using asterisks (`*`). Hollow patterns add a challenge by printing only outlines.

- **Asterisk Patterns** (`Asteric_Patterns` folder):
  - Basic programs to create solid shapes like triangles, squares, diamonds, and more using asterisks.

- **Hollow Patterns** (`Hallow_Patterns` folder):
  - Advanced variations where only the borders of shapes are printed, emphasizing loop control and spacing.

### Programs

This folder contains standalone notebooks solving common numerical and logical problems. These are classic exercises to reinforce concepts like recursion, modulo operations, and digit manipulation.

- `armstrong.ipynb`: Checks if a number is an Armstrong number (sum of cubes of digits equals the number).
- `binary.ipynb`: Converts numbers to binary representation.
- `composite_num.ipynb`: Identifies composite numbers (integers greater than 1 with more than two factors).
- `disarum.ipynb`: Checks for Disarium numbers (sum of digits raised to their position powers equals the number).
- `Evilodi.ipynb`: Finds Evil numbers (even number of 1s in binary representation).
- `factors.ipynb`: Lists all factors of a given number.
- `Factorial.ipynb`: Computes the factorial of a number (e.g., \$ n! \$).
- `fizzbuzz.ipynb` / `FizzBuzz.ipynb`: Prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for both.
- `Happy.ipynb`: Determines if a number is happy (repeatedly sums squares of digits until reaching 1).
- `integer.ipynb`: Basic operations on integers.
- `lcm.ipynb`: Calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers.
- `palindrom.ipynb` / `palindrome.ipynb`: Checks if a number or string reads the same forwards and backwards.
- `Perfect.ipynb`: Identifies perfect numbers (sum of proper divisors equals the number).
- `Poly_prime.ipynb`: Explores polyprimes or palindromic primes.
- `Prime_num.ipynb`: Checks if a number is prime and finds primes in a range.
- `reverse.ipynb`: Reverses a number or string.
- `strong.ipynb`: Checks for strong numbers (factorial of digits sum equals the number).
- `Sum_digits.ipynb`: Sums the digits of a number.
- `Sum_even.ipynb`: Calculates the sum of even numbers in a range.
- `EMIRP.ipynb`: Finds Emirp numbers (primes that remain prime when digits are reversed, e.g., 13 â†’ 31).

And more programs for additional challenges!
